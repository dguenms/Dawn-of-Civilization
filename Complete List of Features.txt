	# instead, only a stability level is stored: collapsing, unstable, shaky, stable, solid
	# stability is divided into five categories: expansion, economy, domestic, foreign and military
	# at every check your stability level can increase or decrease depending on your score, if the level drops low enough a crisis occurs
