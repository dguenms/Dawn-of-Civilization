RFC Dawn of Civilization
Complete List of Features (as of version 1.8)

The modmod is based on RFC Epic/Marathon 1.21 and therefore includes all features of RFC v1.187 for BtS unless otherwise noted.

GAME MECHANICS
# enabled Epic/Marathon speeds (RFCMarathon modmod by embryodead)
# Plague can only reduce units to 50% health, never kill them
# The Temple of Solomon spawns with Yerushalayim
# Added civ specific great people names (for all civs except Portugal, Khmer, Maya)
# Dynamic civilization names adapted to the new civics
# added a civic-specific leader switch mechanic:
	# Germany and Spain switch to Hitler and Franco when fascist, respectively
	# China and Russia switch to Mao and Stalin when communist, respectively
	# Cixi and Nicholas II added as non-communist leaders
# Added the "rebirth" mechanism: some dead civs respawn as another civilization at a certain date (e.g. Rome as Italy), if the civ is still alive, no rebirth happens
# civilizations are more likely to collapse after a certain historical date (e.g. Rome after 476 AD)
# adapted the civic requirement mechanic for buildings and units from Sword of Islam
# all civilizations have their core areas revealed at spawn
# modified the AI to be more likely to adopt historical civics
  (basically the "favourite civic" feature per civ and per era)
# added a war on spawn between Turkey and Arabia
# doubled the chance of war on spawn between Arabia and Egypt
# some civilizations (Arabia, Mongolia, Turkey) fight their initial spawn wars longer
# conqueror events automatically trigger war
# AI conquerors now made to attack native cities immediately

# you need to discover Astronomy to train settlers on other continents than your capital's
# Fascist names now also with (Autocracy or Totalitarism) and no Parliament
# New total wars on spawn: Rome on Greece, Persia on Babylonia and Phoenicia
# Implemented the "birth in capital" mechanics, where certain civilization flip the city on their spawn plot on spawn (currently only used for Byzantium)
# reduced the intervals between early AI wars
# added a routine that removes Christianity from Anatolia when Byzantium collapses
# added a Mongol horde event that spawns armies for AI Mongolia at the Russian, Persian and Seljuk borders
# scripted spread of Islam to Indonesia around 1500 AD
# religion spread turns pagan temples into temples of the new religion
# pagan temples can't be built in cities with religions
# resurrected civs get predertemined capitals
# resurrection can only happen to civs in historical intervals
# Nationalism is not necessary for resurrections, but increases their likeliness
# "free tech" events like the Oracle or Liberalism only allow you to choose techs from your current era or earlier
# relocated war maps into the DLL, they now also influence which cities the AI attacks
# protected Middle Eastern cities from getting razed by Seljuks and Mongols
# culture level of independent or minor civs is limited to 2
# as long as you own no cities, you can enter enemy territory and found cities there (AI only)
# great people names now appear in semi-chronological order (there's still some randomness involved, but modern names won't appear early anymore)
# the AI can't win the game during autoplay anymore
# Seljuk and independent cities immediately flip to Turkey to offset their lack of starting settlers
# former city garrisons get pushed out before they flip to certain civs (Italy, Turkey) to prevent them from becoming too strong
# building a Trading Company as Portugal, Spain, France, England, Netherlands gives you the option to acquire Asian cities in your civs historical area by force or gold

INTERFACE

# the mouseover info box now displays tile stability in five categories:
	# Core Area (dark green): no penalty, enemy cities here give a stability hit
	# Historical Area (light green): no penalty
	# Contested Area (yellow): no direct penalty, but indirect because this tile is part of the core of another civ
	# Foreign Area (orange): penalty if number of controlled tiles exceeds a certain tolerance
	# Foreign Core Area (red): like foreign area, but also indirect penalties because this tile is part of the core of another civ
