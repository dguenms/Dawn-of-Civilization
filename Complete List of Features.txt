	* Historical (light green): no penalty for expanding here
	* Contested (yellow): no penalty for expanding here, but risk of a respawn of another civilization
	* Foreign (orange): penalty for expanding here
	* Foreign Core (red): penalty for expanding here, risk of a respawn of another civilization
* Included the UHV progress display in the victory screen from Sword of Islam by embryodead
* The terrain tile tooltip displays when a tile is relevant to one of your UHV goals
* Tooltips display the contributing factors to stability scores in the economy advisor

HISTORICAL IMMERSION
* Civilizations are more likely to collapse after a certain historical date
* Christianity is removed from Anatolia when Byzantium collapses
* Mongol Hordes event: armies spawn at their borders when AI Mongolia makes first contact with Seljuks, Persia and Russia
* Predetermined capitals for respawning civilizations
* Seljuk and independent cities immediately flip to Turkey to balance their lack of starting settlers
* City garrisons are pushed out to their owner's capital for certain spawns (e.g. Italy, Turkey)
* India cannot respawn as long as the Mughals are still alive
* AI Russia and America receive settlers or conquerors to reach the American West Coast and Siberian Pacific coast respectively
* AI Greece and Rome receive conquerors to create their historical empires
* Constantinople and Amsterdam start with a larger population and more buildings
* If Buddhism does not exist in 100 AD, it is autofounded instead
* The existence of the Catholic shrine and the Apostolic Palace is guaranteed by the time of the Holy Roman spawn
* AI civilizations receive a free worker and defender when founding a colony
* The capital of AI civilizations automatically relocates under appropriate circumstances
* AI Seljuks and Mughals spread state religion on city conquest

AI BEHAVIOR
* Conquerors will attack native cities immediately
* Some civilizations (e.g. Arabia, Mongolia, Turkey) fight their initial wars longer and more aggressively
* Reduced intervals between early AI wars
* Beyond declarations of war, AI war maps also influence which cities it tries to capture
* AI war maps also influence which independent cities are targeted
* Discouraged Seljuk and Mongol conquerors from razing cities in the Middle East
* It is harder for far away civilizations to become worst enemies
* Cities will not be founded on food resources anymore
* Classical leaders monopolize less to enable more tech trade in that era
* War and peace with minor civilizations is disregarded when considering to become a vassal
* Minor civilizations will not use nuclear weapons
* Maps are generally less valuable in trades
* You will only be asked to join a war if you share a border with the target
* AIs are willing to trade away their last resource or corporation resources if the trade is otherwise favorable
* AI resource value judgment now includes the overall benefit they or their trade partner receive from a resource, including number of cities

BALANCE
* Several classical wonders are prevented from being built in later eras
* China cannot trade techs it has a monopoly on to reduce the benefit of its UP
* The AI cannot start wonders before the player spawns if they are part of the player UHV
* Overall increase in tech costs durng the Industrial and Modern eras

PERFORMANCE
* Relocated AI war maps to the DLL to improve performance
* Included an option to ignore UHV checks for AI civs (enabled by default)
* Included an option to enable graphics paging to reduce memory consumption

* Stealth Destroyers detect Submarines as (presumably) intended
* Cutting contact with a vassal is impossible when there is still contact to their master
* Fixed the Switch Religion espionage mission to hae 1000% the previous cost as intended
* Fixed a bug that decreased costs for all technologies in later scenarios
