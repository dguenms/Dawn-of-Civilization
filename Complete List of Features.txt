RFC Dawn of Civilization
Complete List of Features (as of version 1.9)

The modmod is based on RFC Epic/Marathon 1.21 and therefore includes all features of RFC v1.187 for BtS unless otherwise noted.

GAME MECHANICS

	# China and Russia switch to Mao and Stalin when communist, respectively
	# Cixi and Nicholas II added as non-communist leaders
# Added the "rebirth" mechanism: some dead civs respawn as another civilization at a certain date (e.g. Rome as Italy), if the civ is still alive, no rebirth happens
# civilizations are more likely to collapse after a certain historical date (e.g. Rome after 476 AD)
# adapted the civic requirement mechanic for buildings and units from Sword of Islam
# all civilizations have their core areas revealed at spawn

# Seljuk and independent cities immediately flip to Turkey to offset their lack of starting settlers
# former city garrisons get pushed out before they flip to certain civs (Italy, Turkey) to prevent them from becoming too strong
# building a Trading Company as Portugal, Spain, France, England, Netherlands gives you the option to acquire Asian cities in your civs historical area by force or gold
# the stability of capitulated civs is reset
# the game now checks for collapse more often, to make up for the increased number of civs
# instead of the oldest civilizations, the civilization with the lowest stability is checked for collapse first
# cities of collapsing civilizations are less likely to flip to neighbouring civilizations due to cultural influence
# disorder in conquered cities limited to four turns

# disabled the exile mechanic
# random events don't involve minor civilizations

	# Tolerate the new sects: State religion remains Catholic, Protestantism spreads to your cities and can even replace Catholicism
