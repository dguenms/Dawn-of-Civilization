		<English>[BOLD]Strategy:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]The Indonesians is not a, but THE jackal of all trades, with Suhartos "Financial" and "Industrious" traits making economy and production a no-brainer and Hayam Wuruks "Imperialistic" and "Aggressive" which allows for empire building in a rather fast speed. At the same time the free Happiness and Culture boost from their [COLOR_BUILDING_TEXT]Candi[COLOR_REVERT] UB grants them easy extendable borders while their UU [COLOR_UNIT_TEXT]Pencak Silat[COLOR_REVERT] strikes down with the increased Strength of a real martial-arts figher.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]The Indonesian archipelago was reached by the Modern Man in 45.000 BC. A migration from Southeast asia around 2000 BC brought many new techniques, and in the 8th century BC, the Indonesian people mastered bronze casting, wet-field rice cultivation, megalithik practises and much more. This allowed villages, towns and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century AD. With the introduction of Buddhism and Hinduism came great monuments, and both the Saleindra and Medang kingdoms built large Hindu and Buddhist stupas commonly called Candis, including the large Borobudut and Prambanan. In the 7th century however, this small kingdom society were soon to come to an end with the rise of Sri Vijaya.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Sri Vijaya was a Malay kingdom formed on the island of Sumatra that flourished on its trade and naval power. While not a state in modern sense, it was rather a confederacy form of society centered on the royal heartland and trading centre of Palembang. Especially the trade trought the Starit of Malacca gained the country financial advantages, and by the end of the 7th century Sri Vijaya controlled numerous trade cities along both sides of the strait. Controlling both the Malacca and Sunda straits, they lived on as a formidable economy and naval power well into the 13th century, and their reign saw the height of the Buddhist influence in Indonesia.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]The decline of Sri Vijaya in the 13th century left many of the Islands with regional kingdoms, and when the kingdom of Singhasari emerged on Java, Kublai Khan sent emmisaries to demand tribute. The Majapahit kingdom, an original ally of Singhasari and also based on Java, allied with the mongols and defeated the Singhasari, but then turned against them and forced the mongol forces to withdraw in confusion. This marked the beginning of the second large Indonesian empire, the Majapahit. Majapahit reached its peak under Hayam Wuruk and his prime minister and commander Gajah Mada, and just a few years after Gajah Madas death, Hayam Wuruk conquered Palembang and ended Sri Vijaya rule in Indonesia. Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that passed through the archipelago. About the time Majapahit was founded, Muslim traders and proselytisers  began entering the area.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]After Majahapits peak in the 14th century, Majapahit power began to decline and was unable to control the rising power of the Sultanate of Malacca. With an increased percantage of the population converting to Islam, the islands saw mostly muslim rule for the next centuries, with numerous different sultanates controlling the Islands.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]In the 16th century, sucsessful european invasions put the Sultanates to an end, with the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British seeking to dominate the Spice trade from India and the 'Spice Islands' of Indonesia. In the early 16 century, the Portuguese manged to control the trade, but in 1602 the Dutch parliament awarded the Dutch East-India Company with a monoploy on all trade and colonial activities in Indonesia at a time before the company controlled any territory in there. In the early 20th century, the monopoly was compleated and the boundaries of modern Indonesia was created. It was also in this period that the first Indoneasian national movement started, basing their idea of one Indonesian nation on Sri Vijaya and Majapahit.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]During World War II, Japan extended their Pacific empire to far away lands, including Indonesia. With the Dutch losing control of the archipelago, Indonesia decleared independance 2 days after Japans defeat and the and of the war. This marked the beginning if modern day Indonesia, and the first president, Sukarno, was elected. He introduced a form of democracy he called the 'Old Order', claiming that western democracy would not work in Indonesia. Although his methods worked in the beginning, he relied more and more on support from the Indonesian communist party, the PKI, which was the largest communist party outside of China and Soviet. With the party gaining more and more power, the militarya and the islamic groups, the other two major powers in Indonesia, got worried, and with the army did everything they could to weaken Sukarno. In March 1967, Sukarno were forced to abdicate and the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly named the army general Suharto as Acting President.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Suharto brought many changes with him during his "New Order", which he named his goverment to differ it from Sukartos "Old Order", and early in his reign he invaded Papua after negotiations with the Dutch about the territory faied. The invasion was however easily repelled, and Suharto then gave them the "Act of Free Choice". After learning the Papuan representaions Indonesia, they were threatened and bribed to vote in Indonesias favor, and the transfer were confirmed by a UN General Assembly meeting. During his period he also transmigrated peole from the overpopluated areas to the more underpopulated islands, stating that this was for the good of the economy and industry and to give the poor a chance and he annexed the earlier Portuguese region East-Timor. During his reign Indonesia also became of OPEC, short for Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, due to large amounts of oil found in the area, something that helped Indonesias wealth, even when corruption was pretty usual during his reign.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Within a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the Indonesian 1998 Revolution and then gained power, the term "New Order" has come to be used pejoratively.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Indonesia today is a country with much history. It granted independence to East-Timor in 2002, and its economy is growing. In 2004 a massive earthquake and tsunami devasted parts of Northern Sumatra, particulary the Aceh region. The same year Susilo Bambang won the first direct presidental election, and he was re-elected in 2009 to a second term. This shows that Indoneasia is on its way into a stable and democratic country, and the possiblity for them raising again as a power in Southeast Asia is still there.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>

		<English>[H1]Hayam Wuruk[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Majapahit[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1334 to 1389 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Born as the fourth monarch of Majapahit, he is credited as a bright, talendted, handsome and exceptional in the courtly martial arts. He was educeted with the purpose of being the next Majapahit king and his reign marked the peak of Majapahit glory.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Rajapatni, Hayams grandmother, died in 1350, Tribhuwana, Hayams mum and queen of Majapahit, had to descend from the throne because she ruled Majapahit under Rajapatni's auspices, and she must relinquish her throne to her son. He inherited the throne at an age of 16, at the same time as his Prime Minister, Gajah Mada, was at the height of his career. With the help of Gajah Mada, Hayam extended his rule all trough the Indonesian archipelago.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1357, Hayam was to marry the princess of the Sunda kingdom. The reasons of this royal engagement was probably a political one, to foster alliance between Majapahit and the Sundanese Kingdom. However in the Bubat incident, the Sunda royal family and their guards was involved in skirmish with Majapahit troops. The planned royal wedding ended in disaster with the death of the princess and the whole of Sunda royal party. The court officials blamed Gajah Mada, because it was his intention to demand submission from Sunda Kingdom that ended in bloodshed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Several years later, Hayam wed his cousin, Sori, and they had a daughter who later married to a relative, Wikramawardhana, who then became the Crown Prince. However Hayam also had a son, Wirabhumi, with the royal concubine, and after Hayams death in 1389, Wirabhumi tried to seize the throne from Wikramawardhana. Although Wikramawardhana crushed the rebellion in the end, is severly weakeden Majapahit and this can be seen as the start of its decline.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>

		<English>[H1]Haji Mohammed Suharto[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Indonesia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1921 - 2008 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Haji Mohammad Soeharto, more commonly referred to as simply Soeharto (General Suharto in the English-speaking world), is a former Indonesian military and political leader. He served as a military officer in the Indonesian National Revolution, but is better known as the long-reigning second President of Indonesia, holding the office from 1967 to 1998.[PARAGRAPH:1]Suharto seized power from his predecessor, the first president of Indonesia Sukarno, through a mixture of force and political maneuvering against the backdrop of foreign and domestic unrest. Over the three decades of his "New Order" regime, Suharto constructed a strong central government along militarist lines. An ability to maintain stability and an avowedly anti-Communist stance won him the economic and diplomatic patronage of several Western governments in the era of the Cold War. For almost all of his three-decade rule, Indonesia experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Suharto regime had won the favour of Western governments and institutions, however, in 1990's, its increasingly authoritarian and corrupt practices became a source of much discontent. After the 1990s brought end of the Cold War, Western concern over communism waned, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. In 1991, the murder of East Timorese civilians in a Dili cemetery, also known as the "Santa Cruz Massacre", caused American attention to focus on its military relations with the Suharto regime and the question of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor. In 1992,this attention resulted in the Congress of the United States passing limitations on IMET assistance to the Indonesian military, over the objections of President George H.W. Bush. In 1993, under President Bill Clinton, the U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission helped pass a resolution expressing deep concern over Indonesian human rights violations in East Timor. The Indonesian invasion and occupation of East Timor has been called the worst instance of genocide (relative to population) since the Holocaust.[PARAGRAPH:1]His almost unquestioned authority over Indonesian affairs slipped dramatically when the Asian financial crisis lowered Indonesians' standard of living and fractured his support among the nation's military, political and civil society institutions. After internal unrest and diplomatic isolation sapped his support in the mid-to-late 1990s, Suharto was forced to resign from the presidency in May 1998.[PARAGRAPH:1]After serving as the public face of Indonesia for over 30 years, Suharto then lived his post-presidential years in virtual seclusion. His legacy remains hotly debated and contested both in Indonesia and in foreign-policy debates in the West. Since his resignation, Suharto retired to a family compound in Central Jakarta, making few public appearances. Efforts to prosecute Suharto have mostly centered around alleged mismanagement of funds, and their force has been blunted due to health concerns. In january 2008, Suharto was taken to the Pertamina hospital, Jakarta, with complications arising from a weak heart, swelling of limbs and stomach, and partial renal failure. He died there at 27th of January at 1:10 pm.</English>

While we know little about him, he is commonly referred to as one of, if not the, greatest of the Sri Vijaya monarchs.[PARAGRAPH:1]During Dharmasetus reign, trade gradually started to relocate to cities in Indochina and away from the Sri Vijaya heartland. He solved this problem by sending raids over there and for a while Indrapura was actually controlled from Palembang (the Sri Vijaya capital). He also successfully incorporated Pan Pan, a kingdom located in the north of the Malay Peninsula into Srivijayan sphere of influence before 775 AD. A stele in Thailand also states that he constructed three sanctuaries dedicated to Bodhisattvas Padmapani, Vajrapani and Buddha in Ligor.[PARAGRAPH:1]He is also noted as head of the Saleindra, and this is the first instance of relationship known existed between Srivijaya and the Sailendra. Yet, he was the son of Jayanasa of Srivijaya and a princess from Tarumanagara. Dewi Tara, the daughter of Dharmasetu later married a member of the Sailendra family by the name of Samaratunga whom later would assumed throne of Srivijaya around 792. The relationship between Srivijaya and the Sailendra became intimately close afterwards.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Pencak Silat is a term used to describe Martial Arts developed in Indonesia. It was originally brought down as an oral tradition, and in the absence of written records, much of its history is known only through myth and archaeological evidence. The people on the Island of Nias, west of Sumatra, one of the main Indonesian islands, were said to be so fierce and fearless warriors that the Sumatrans left them alone.[PARAGRAPH:1]India and China were the first civilizations outside of Southeast Asia that Indonesia got contact with, and with them came religion, culture and martial arts. This led to the invention of Silat as a form of martial arts, and the first empire recorded to train silat warriors in a structured manner is the Sri Vijaya where folklore tells that it was created by a woman named Rama Sukana who witnessed a fight between a tiger and a large bird. By using the animals' movements, she was able to fend off a group of drunken men that attacked her. She then taught the techniques to her husband Rama Isruna from whom they were formally passed down. There are several variations of this story depending on the region where it is told.[PARAGRAPH:1]With Sri Vijaya in control of the Malacca Strait and thus being one of the most important Buddhist nations in Southeast Asia, many buddhist monks came to study and live there. Among these were Chinese, Khmers, Javanese, Siamese adn Malays, bringing with it new forms of Silat and both allowed Pancak Sialt to spread trough the Archipelago and get contact with similar fighting systems.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the defeat of Sri Vijaya by the South-Indian Chola, a decline came in all Indonesian kingdoms, but this also gave rise to the Majapahit empire. This was the first empire to unite all of Indonesia's major islands. From its base in eastern Java, Indonesian culture flowered and pencak silat became highly refined and weapons made by Majapahit smiths were greatly prized in the Malay Peninsula. Some of these weapons were the dagger like Kris or the Trisula trident.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pencak Silat was later used by freedom-fighters against the Dutch colonists. During this time the Bugis and Makassar people from south Sulawesi were very well-known as expert sailors, navigators and warriors. After Indonesia's independence, pencak silat was brought to Europe and the art is now popular in France, Spain and the Netherlands.</English>

The people on the Island of Nias, west of Sumatra, one of the main Indonesian islands, were said to be so fierce and fearless warriors that the Sumatrans left them alone.[PARAGRAPH:1]India and China were the first civilizations outside of Southeast Asia that Indonesia got contact with, and with them came religion, culture and martial arts. This led to the invention of Silat as a form of martial arts, and the first empire recorded to train silat warriors in a structured manner is the Sri Vijaya where folklore tells that it was created by a woman named Rama Sukana who witnessed a fight between a tiger and a large bird. By using the animals' movements, she was able to fend off a group of drunken men that attacked her. She then taught the techniques to her husband Rama Isruna from whom they were formally passed down. There are several variations of this story depending on the region where it is told.[PARAGRAPH:1]With Sri Vijaya in control of the Malacca Strait and thus being one of the most important Buddhist nations in Southeast Asia, many buddhist monks came to study and live there. Among these were Chinese, Khmers, Javanese, Siamese adn Malays, bringing with it new forms of Silat and both allowed Pancak Sialt to spread trough the Archipelago and get contact with similar fighting systems.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the defeat of Sri Vijaya by the South-Indian Chola, a decline came in all Indonesian kingdoms, but this also gave rise to the Majapahit empire. This was the first empire to unite all of Indonesia's major islands. From its base in eastern Java, Indonesian culture flowered and pencak silat became highly refined and weapons made by Majapahit smiths were greatly prized in the Malay Peninsula. Some of these weapons were the dagger like Kris or the Trisula trident.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pencak Silat was later used by freedom-fighters against the Dutch colonists. During this time the Bugis and Makassar people from south Sulawesi were very well-known as expert sailors, navigators and warriors. After Indonesia's independence, pencak silat was brought to Europe and the art is now popular in France, Spain and the Netherlands.</Italian>
