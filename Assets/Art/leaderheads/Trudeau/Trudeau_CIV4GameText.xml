		<English>[H1]Pierre Elliot Trudeau [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Canada[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1919 - 2000[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Trudeau was a charismatic figure who dominated the Canadian political scene, arousing passionate reactions. "He haunts us still," one biography begins. Admirers praise the force of Trudeau's intellect. They salute his political acumen in preserving national unity and bringing into force the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Detractors fault Trudeau for arrogance, deplore economic policies that increased the national debt, and criticize him for increasing a sense of political alienation in western provinces. Nevertheless, few would dispute the assertion that Trudeau was a towering figure who helped redefine Canada.[PARAGRAPH:1]Trudeau led Canada through some of its most tumultuous times and was often the centre of controversy. Known for his flamboyance, he sometimes wore sandals in the House of Commons; dated celebrities; occasionally used obscenities to insult his opponents and on May 7, 1977, did a pirouette behind the back of Queen Elizabeth II. He was also known as an author, political activist, and professor from early in his adult life. As prime minister, he patriated the Canadian Constitution from the British Parliament to Canada and incorporated in it the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[PARAGRAPH:1]Born in Montreal, Trudeau earned a law degree at the Universite de Montreal in 1943, followed by a master's in political economy at Harvard. During his attendance at the Universite de Montreal,Trudeau was conscripted into the army, and joined the Canadian Officers Training Corps under the wartime National Resources Mobilization Act of 1940. Trudeau served with other conscripts in the home guard, since it was only later, starting in 1944, that limited numbers of conscripts were sent overseas, with the vast majority of those sent overseas being volunteers. He said he was willing to become involved in the war, but he believed that to do so would be to turn his back on a Quebec population he considered to have been betrayed by the Mackenzie King government. In a 1942 Outremont by-election, he campaigned for the Quebec anti-conscription candidate Jean Drapeau (see Conscription Crisis of 1944), and was eventually expelled from the Officers' Training Corps for lack of discipline. After the war, he attended the Institut d'etudes politiques de Paris in Paris in 1946-47, and spent the following year at the London School of Economics.[PARAGRAPH:1]As prime minister, Trudeau espoused participatory democracy as a means of making Canada a "Just Society". His desire for greater citizen involvement in government appears to have been frustrated by lack of support within his party, and he later opposed greater involvement for citizens in representative democracy. He vigorously defended the newly implemented universal health care and regional development programs as means of making society more just. In foreign affairs, Trudeau was not always in line with the Americans. He made Canada the first western power to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and went on a state visit to Beijing. He was known to be a friend of Fidel Castro.[PARAGRAPH:1]In retirement, Trudeau rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press. However, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. His opposition was a critical factor leading to the defeat of the two proposals. He also spoke out against Jacques Parizeau and the Parti Quebecois with less effect. In his final years, Trudeau commanded respect in English Canada, but was regarded with suspicion in Quebec due to his role in the 1982 constitutional deal which was seen to have excluded the province. Trudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the Club of Rome.</English>
