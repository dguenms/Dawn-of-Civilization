## CvAltRoot
##
## Tells BUG where to locate its files when it cannot find them normally.
## This is common when using the /AltRoot Civ4 feature or sometimes on
## non-English operating systems and Windows Vista.
##
## HOW TO USE
##
## 1. Change the text in the quotes below to match the full path to the
##    "Beyond the Sword" folder that contains the CivilizationIV.ini file.
##    Make sure to use forward slashes (/), even for Windows paths.
##
##    Windows XP: "C:/Documents and Settings/[UserName]/My Documents/My Games/Beyond the Sword"
##
##    Windows Vista: "C:/Users/[UserName]/Documents/My Games/Beyond the Sword"
##
##    MacOS: "/home/[UserName]/Documents/Beyond the Sword"
##
## 2. Copy this file to the "Python" folder.
##    When BUG is installed as a mod, the folder is "Assets/Python".
##    When BUG is installed normally, the folder is "CustomAssets/Python".
