# LEADERHEADS
# added Maria II as a late Portuguese leaderhead
# added a civic-specific leader switch mechanic:
	# Germany and Spain switch to Hitler and Franco when fascist, respectively
	# China and Russia switch to Mao and Stalin when communist, respectively
	# Cixi and Nicholas II added as non-communist leaders
# replaced the previous Abu Bakr leaderhead with the Omani leader from Sword of Islam (leaderhead by Ekmek, background by Amra)

# NEW CIVILIZATION (ALPHA)
# added the Italian civilization
	# leaderhead: Victor Emmanuel
	# unique unit: Bersagliere (Infantry with 2 movement)
	# unique building: Art Studio (Forge with +1 happiness from marble, dye and one artist slot)
# added an incomplete scripted spawn for Italy in 1861 (actually a respawn of Rome), the player is able to switch to them (for testing purposes)
	# KNOWN PROBLEM: City graphics turn to ruins after the switch, city panels disappear
	                 I have decided to release this version dispite this flaw to make all other new features available
	# The civ also still carries many artifacts of Rome, like city names, dynamic names, stability maps
	# There is no UP and UHV

# WONDERS
# Wonders of the classical Mediterranean no longer require marble, but the Pantheon civic to be built
# Theodosian Walls are now pre-built in Constantinople in the 600 AD scenario
# Theodosian Walls are now displayed as walls on the map (graphics adapted from Sword of Islam)
# The Pantheon is now pre-built in Rome in the 600 AD scenario
# San Marco Cathedral now requires a harbor and therefore sea access
# The Parthenon now expires after you discover Theology (its effect was intended for Rome and Greece, seeing a Turkish democracy in the 600 AD scenario feels wrong)
# Effect of the Temple of Solomon changed: it now doubles the shrine revenue limit for its owner and expires with Liberalism
# The Spiral Minaret now has its old effect again (+2 gold per religious building)
# increased Mezquita's effect to +2 beakers per specialist

# UNITS
# replaced Maceman with Longswordsman (heavy infantry graphics from Charlemagne scenario)
# new unit: Levy (strength 6, +25% against mounted units, produced with food, requires Feudalism and Vassalage)
# Knights now require Feudalism and the Vassalage civic
# Camel Archers and Keshiks now require Feudalism, but not the Vassalage civic
# Cataphracts still require Machinery and no civic
# Longbowman now require Guilds

# GAME MECHANICS
# civilizations are more likely to collapse after a certain historical date (e.g. Rome after 476 AD)
# adapted the civic requirement mechanic for buildings and units from Sword of Islam
# all civilizations have their core areas revealed at spawn
# fixed various dynamic city names

# INTERFACE
# the mouseover info box now displays tile stability in five categories:
	# Core Area (dark green): no penalty, enemy cities here give a stability hit
	# Historical Area (light green): no penalty
	# Contested Area (yellow): no direct penalty, but indirect because this tile is part of the core of another civ
	# Foreign Area (orange): penalty if number of controlled tiles exceeds a certain tolerance
	# Foreign Core Area (red): like foreign area, but also indirect penalties because this tile is part of the core of another civ
# removed embassies and corporation headquarters from the wonders civilopedia
# enabled display of "produced using food" in the civilopedia
# fixed various wrong entries for civics in the civicoption menu and civilopedia:
	# "no state religion"
	# "post-communist crisis"
	# "risk of great depression"
	# "transition to democracy"
# reenabled the "great person born" messages known from vanilla BtS

# CIVICS
# modified the AI to be more likely to adopt historical civics
  (basically the "favourite civic" feature per civ and per era)
  this was especially used to encourage Greece, Rome, Babylonia, Phoenicia and Egypt to adopt Pantheon, and to discourage China and India to do so
# Aristocracy now gives additional free units and +2 unit experience
# Vassalage now gives +50% worker speed and allows to train Levies and Knights
# Representation doesn't influence city maintenance anymore
# Parliamentarism now creates unhappiness for all civs that don't adopt it (ca. 2/3 as Emancipation in vanilla) instead of a free specialist

# CIVILIZATIONS
# Egypt's UP now includes enabled Pantheon civic at start
# added a new coat of arms for Korea (the Ihwamun)
# Phoenicia now has its own UP: The Power of Seafaring - +50% trade route yield
# Removed China's second UHV condition (no cities lost to Barbarians or Mongols until 1400 AD)
# Added a new second UHV condition for China: have four golden ages until 1850 AD

# BALANCE AND BUGFIXING
# Increased "switch civic" and "switch religion" espionage mission costs
# modified some civic stability modifiers
# fixed all civic-dependant events to be triggered by an appropriate of the new civics
# deleted the "you have entered the medieval era" screen after Netherlands spawn
# fixed Justinian's starting civics in the 600 AD scenario
# France doesn't get Musketeers at the conqueror event anymore
